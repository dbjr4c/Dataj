## Final Project 

This folder contains the python tools I used to pull down bill names and descriptions for a story I wrote for the Columbia Missourian. In the midst of former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens' scandal, the government was essentially at a standstill. Legislators and the press corps alike would also gripe "this has to be the least productive year for legislation in recent memory." 

Problem was, nobody knew how many bills were introduced vs. passed in the previous years. Nobody knew definitively even how many bills were passed two years ago. So, I decided to endeavor to answer this question. I used the OpenStates API to pull introduced and signed bills and the sponsors from 2012-2017. Using a simple script, I also pulled down all of the local Boone County legislator's information for a story we eventually turned into a "report card."

While Gov. Greitens' scandal did slow down legislation, the finding I found most interesting was that only 7 percent of bills make it into law each year. 

## Shots Fired

This folder contains the python tools I built to interact with the Google Maps API. These tools were used to convert a fairly large data set of all of the shots fired in Columbia, Missouri within the past few years into plotable coordinates. Originally, the data set only contained addresses, many partial, so after some cleaning, I built a script that ran each row through the Google Maps API and converted the addresses to coordinates so that my colleague, John Sadler, could then map the shots in Tableau.

## Misc

The rest of the files are miscellaneous projects I did for my data journalism class taught by Chase Davis.
