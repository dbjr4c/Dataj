# Github Assignment

For my assignment, I chose a project I found on Propublica's github account. 

The Propublica team built a Google Chrome extension that runs in the background of your browser and stores data on Facebook ads when you browse through your page. The goal is crowdsource a database of online political advertisements. 

For now, Propublica is going to roll out the extension — which is built using a combination of python, css, java and rust — for use in the German elections. The organization is working with German publicantions like Der Spiegel. Propublica hopes to have it bulletproofed for the 2018 US midterms.

I think this project is incredibly interesting. As far as I can see, the extension looks like it's pretty easy to create (I determined this by  comparing the size this repository to others). 

Political advertisements in the online realm is a topic that needs more data-driven coverage, especially for social media. And using an extension is an ingenius way to crowdsouce an investigation. You simply download it, and it runs in the background. You can forget about it. Who could turn that down?

That being said, I still have a few questions. First and foremost, what is "React?" I looked all over their website, and I couldn't find anything that made sense to me. Also, what is rust? What benefits does it have over other languages? Why was it necessary for this project?
